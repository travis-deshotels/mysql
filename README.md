# mysql  
This project contains the database tables that were part of a group project that I reworked into my foodApp project. That project contains fewer tables. This was an exercise in mapping MySQL tables using Hibernate without Spring. Tested with MySQL version 8.0.28.

Project uses   
* Hibernate
* Lombok
* Junit
